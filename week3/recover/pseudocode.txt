open memory card file
    fopen file
    check it is not null
find beginning of JPEG
    look for first 3 bytes
        0xff 0xd8 0xff
    look for last byte:
        0xe00, oxe1, 0xe2, ... 0xef
    stored side by side
    each block is 512 bytes
open a new JPEG
write 512 bytes until new jpeg IS FOUND
detect end of file

open card file
repeat until end of card
    read 512 bytes into a buffer
    start of a new JPEG?
        yes -> ... then we start a jpeg
        no -> ... then we ask if already found JPEG
    already found a JPEG? 
        no -> ... discard previous 512 
        yes -> ... close previous then open a new one
close any remaining files
